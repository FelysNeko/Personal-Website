In order to gain a deeper understanding in Python, I learned C and became really interested in building programming languages. I also taught myself CentOS for server maintenance and Kali Linux for hacking knowledge. (RHEL and GNU/Linux are pretty different, so it took me a long time to get comfortable with both of them). Then, I came to the university and quickly realized that my tech stack was too wired and incomplete to find a co-op. Therefore, I started to learn C++ (ECE150) and web development skills like React.js and Typescript."
