# Personal-Website
Personal website made with React.js front-end and Flask back-end. Note that the website might show 403 sometimes due to server issues.

## Front-end
More information coming soon...

## Back-end
Flask back-end is not the best solution for the project, it acts like a test program for front-end api fetch. Alternatives could be using express.js with MongoDB, Notion API, etc. Since the website usually does not have too much back-end traffic, you may also remove the back-end and use the static version instead which is easier to be deployed.
